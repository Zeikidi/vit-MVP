          <h3>What Is Meditation?</h3>
          <small>Posted by Dan on August 15</small>
          <p>
            Meditation is the flow of continuous thought of one thing.
            Meditation is the keeping of one idea alone always like the
            continuous flow of oil from one vessel to another. A continuous flow
            of perception or thought is Dhyana or meditation. Meditation is a
            mysterious ladder which reaches from earth to heaven, from error to
            truth, from darkness to light, from pain to bliss, from restlessness
            to abiding peace, from ignorance to knowledge, from mortality to
            immortality. Meditation leads to Knowledge of the Self which brings
            about eternal peace, supreme bliss. Meditation prepares you for the
            integral experience or direct intuitive knowledge.

          <h3>What Is Concentration?</h3>
          <small>Posted by Dan on August 16</small>
          <p>
            A baby's eyes are riveted on a flower or a butterfly. It keeps
            looking at the object with unwinking eyes, eyes full of wonder, for
            minutes together.
          </p>
          <p>
            A mother calls her teenage daughter to go and have lunch, but there
            is no response. The call is repeated twice, thrice; still there is
            no response. The girl just does not hear, though her ears are very
            much open. Nor is she deaf. What could be the reason, then, for her
            not hearing? Her mind is immersed in a Sherlock Holmes or a Harold
            Robbins; her eyes are glued to the lines; her face is buried in the
            book.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the dilapidated building of an elementary school, the class is
            on. The teacher explains something and then asks the children, "Did
            it enter?". There is an instant response from the backmost bench:
            "Only the tail has not entered yet!". The earnest voice belongs to a
            boy who has been all along intently watching the struggle of a rat
            to wriggle out of the class room through a hole in the wall. It has
            managed to squeeze in its body, but its tail is still not gone in.
            Perhaps the hole is blocked.
          </p>
          <p>
            These are everyday examples of concentration. Attention,
            concentration, meditation-these are different degrees of the same
            process. It is fixing the mind on a single object or idea to the
            exclusion of everything else.

          <h3>Padmasana (Lotus Pose)</h3>
          <small>Posted by Dan on August 17</small>
          <p>
            Place the right foot on the left thigh, the left foot on the right thigh. Put the hands on the thighs near the knee joints. Keep the head, neck and the trunk in one straight line. Close the eyes and concentrate on the space between the two eye-brows or heart. This is called as lotus pose or Kamala Asana. This is very good for meditation.
